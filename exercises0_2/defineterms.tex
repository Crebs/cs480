Define each of these terms:

\begin{itemize}
\item set
  \subitem An unordered collection of unique objects, called \term{element}s.  Sets are usually designated by their \term{element}s listed within curly braces, such as $A=\set{a,b,c}$.
\item element(s)
  \subitem Any particular object contained in a \term{set} or \term{sequence}.
  Also known as \term{member}.
\item member(s)
  \subitem Any particular object contained in a \term{set}.
  Also known as \term{element}.
\item subset
  \subitem A \term{set} which does not include any \term{element}s that are not included in another \term{set}, known as the \term{superset}.  Thus, if \term{A} is a subset of \term{B}, then there are no elements in \term{A} that are not found in \term{B}.
\item proper subset
  \subitem A \term{subset} which does not include all the \term{element}s of its \term{superset}.  That is, a \term{proper subset} will have at least one \term{element} less than its \term{superset}.
\item multiset
  \subitem An unordered collection of \term{element}s which may or may not be repeated.
\item infinite set
  \subitem A \term{set} which contains an infinite number of \term{element}s.
\item natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$
  \subitem Generally refers to the positive \term{integer}s, $\set{1,2,3,\ldots}$, though in some contexts it is the non-negative \term{integer}s, $\set{0,1,2, \ldots}$.
\item integers $\mathbb{Z}$
  \subitem The positive and negative whole numbers and zero, $\set{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots}$.  This is equivalent to the \term{natural number}s, their opposites ({\ie} negatives), and zero.
\item empty set $\varnothing$
  \subitem The \term{set} which has no \term{element}s.  Often marked $\varnothing$, but sometimes denoted $\set{}$.
\item union $\cup$
  \subitem A \term{set operation} which generates a new \term{set} containing all the \term{element}s of each source \term{set}.
\item intersection $\cap$
  \subitem A \term{set operation} which generates a new \term{set} containing only the \term{element}s which are found in each of the source \term{set}s.
\item complement $\overline{A}$
  \subitem A \term{set operation}, which generates a new \term{set} containing all the \term{element}s in the universe of discourse which are \emph{not} found in the source \term{set}.  Frequently denoted by a line over the source set, thus the complement of $A$ is $\overline{A}$.
\item compliment
  \subitem A polite expression of praise or admiration. A thing that should be given to Brother Neff frequently. 
\item Venn diagram
  \subitem Shows all hypothetically possible logical relations between a finite collection of \term{sets} using a circle as a representation of a single \term{set}
\item sequence
  \subitem A \term{function} from a \term{subset} of the \term{set} of integers (usually either the \term{set} \{0, 1, 2 ...\} or the \term{set} \{1, 2, 3, ... \}) to a \term{set} S. 
\item tuple(s)
   \subitem Finite \term{sequence(s)}
\item k-tuple
   \subitem A \term{sequence} of $k$ \term{elements}, where $k$ is a positive integer
\item pair
   \subitem A \term{sequence} with 2 elements or a 2-\term{tuple}
\item power set 
  \subitem The \term{power set} of the \term{set} $A$ is the \term{set} of all \term{subsets} of $A$; denoted by the notation $\mathcal{P}\left(A\right)$
\item Cartesian product $A \times B$
  \subitem The \term{set} of all ordered \term{pair}s $(a, b)$, where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. Thus, $A \times B = \{(a,b) | a\in A \text{and} \ b\in B\}$. It is important to point out that $A \times B$ is generally not the same as $B \times A$.
\item cross product $A \times B$
  \subitem The \term{set} of all ordered \term{pair}s $(a, b)$, where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. Also known as a \term{Cartesian product}.
  %%The \term{cross product} $a \times b$ is defined as a vector $c$ that is perpendicular to both $a$ and $b$, with a direction given by the right-hand rule and a magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram that the vectors span. The cross product is defined by the formula: $a \times b = a b \sin \theta n$
\item function
  \subitem A \term{function} $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is an assignment of exactly one \term{element} of $B$ to each \term{element} of $A$. We write $f(a) = b$ if $b$ is the unique \term{element} of $B$ assigned by the \term{function} $f$ to the \term{element} $a$ of $A$. If $f$ is a \term{function} from $A$ to $B$, we write $f \colon A \to B$. Also known as a \term{mapping}.
\item mapping

\item range
   \subitem The \term{set} of all images from a \term{subset} of a \term{function's} \term{domain}, where an image is the \term{set} of all outputs obtained when the \term{function} is evaluated at each \term{element} of the \term{subset}
\item onto
   \subitem A \term{function} that uses all the \term{elements} of the \term{codomain}
\item surjective
   \subitem \term{onto}
\item surjection
   \subitem What a \term{function} is called when it is \term{onto}
\item one-to-one
   \subitem A \term{function} is \term{one-to-one} iff $f(a) = f(b)$ implies that $a = b$ for all $a$ and $b$. It never maps two different \term{elements} to the same place.
